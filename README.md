I have made my website open source with MIT LICENSE. Please read about it but in my understanding it's as FREE and JUST as it could get which also aligns with my path forward in this lifetime. If you want to shine in this world, you will begin to attract good stuff. And here we are crossing paths.

Feel free to clone this repository and personalize it for your own use, please don't forget to share the love by MIT LICENSE to others who may wish to follow. 
If you have any question, you know where to knock <ping>
