CAUTION you are lingering in an OPEN, FREE but SAFE SPACE. If you have certain inhibitions, they might be exposed in this path forward as we get ready to shine the light.
If you bumped into THE YOGIC LENS, and you liked the website and you would want to have something like that for yourself, you have come to the right place. If not, jump to the end, coz you may want to ignore the LICENSE information. I have donated my time and creativity to express myself through THE YOGIC LENS channel. What I stand for is also how I want to lead, and that's why I decided to donate my time and energy to this open source community. It's under MIT LICENSE and if could say one word about it, it would be FREE_DOM. If you want to shine your light in this world, please come together.

Feel free to clone this repository and personalize it for your own use, and share the love back by using MIT LICENSE for others who may wish to follow. 
If you have any question, you know where to knock <ping>
