DISCLAIMER: THIS GETS A LITTLE ESOTERIC, IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A LOGICAL PERSON, THIS MAY NOT BE A GOOD FIT FOR YOU. 

CAUTION: We are lingering in an OPEN, FREE, but SAFE SPACE just like our beautiful COSMOS. If we have certain inhibitions, they might be exposed in this path forward as we get ready to shine the light on ourselves and beyond. If you bumped into theyogiclens.org, and you liked the website and you would want to have something like that for yourself, you have come to the right place. If not, I will try to keep the important information short.

This is my effort to express the YOGI within. They say, a YOGI could play around with time as they can trascend into another dimension just like an electron would jump an orbit and release or consume some energy, that's when time gets non linear. If you ever want to tune inward or outward, you might find it helpful to use the astrological weather model based on astronomical science. As Bhagvad Gita says the entire universe is within us and astrology has served as a good model to tune into both the dimensions. But, coming back to theyogiclens.org where you could checkout the astrological weather of what's happening in the cosmos right now or coming up next. You may also find it useful if you would want to igni(t)e a join(t) of ancient knowledge funneling though a modern outlook FIR filter. It also has a FREE collection of some paid stories on Medium.com. I decided to donate my time and energy to this open source community as I feel strongly for the cause. It's under MIT LICENSE and if I to express it in a word it's FREE_DOM. If you want to shine your light in this world, lets come together and JOIN OUR forces. 

Feel free to clone this repository and personalize it for your own use, and share the love back by using MIT LICENSE for others who may wish to follow. I haven't gotten a chance to integrate any form of donation so don't worry about it until its ready. I may need it at some time to keep this space running at the pace I want to serve HUMANITY. Life is short, on this side of the lens, but we do understand time is non linear and it stretches and contracts differently sometimes.
