DISCLAIMER: THIS GETS A LITTLE ESOTERIC, IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A LOGICAL PERSON, THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BOTHER YOU. 

CAUTION: We are lingering in an OPEN, FREE, but SAFE SPACE just like our beautiful COSMOS. If we have certain inhibitions, they might be exposed in this path forward as we get ready to shine the light on ourselves and beyond. If you bumped into theyogiclens.org, and you liked the website and you would want to have something like that for yourself, you have come to the right place. If not, I will try to keep the important information short.

This is my effort to express the YOGI within. If you ever want to tune into what's happening in the cosmos now and coming up next, or want to smoke a joint of ancient knowledge with a modern outlook, please visit theyogiclens.org. It also has a FREE collection of some paid stories on Medium.com. I decided to donate my time and energy to this open source community as I feel strongly for the cause. It's under MIT LICENSE and if could say one word about it, it would be FREE_DOM. If you want to shine your light in this world, lets come together and JOIN OUR forces. 

Feel free to clone this repository and personalize it for your own use, and share the love back by using MIT LICENSE for others who may wish to follow. I haven't gotten a chance to integrate any form of donation so don't worry about it until its ready. I may need it at some time to keep this space running at the pace I want to serve HUMANITY. Life is short, on this side of the lens, but we do understand time is non linear and it stretches and contracts differently sometimes, often linearly except when you transcend. 

If you have any questions or comments, you know where to knock <ping>
